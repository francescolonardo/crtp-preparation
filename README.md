## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting my preparation for the Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) exam. It includes structured notes, technical explanations, and practical walkthroughs covering key topics in Active Directory security and exploitation, aligning with the CRTP curriculum.

The materials are organized to provide a clear understanding of each concept, with detailed examples, input commands, and corresponding outputs. This allows readers to follow along without needing to replicate every step on their own test environment.

Each section covers essential red teaming techniques, including Active Directory enumeration, privilege escalation, lateral movement, Kerberos attacks, and domain dominance strategies. The repository highlights the methodologies, tools, and best practices used by red teamers to assess and exploit AD environments.

Whether you're preparing for the CRTP certification or looking to enhance your knowledge of Active Directory security, this repository serves as both a study guide and a technical resource for anyone interested in offensive security and red teaming.

- [x] **Enumerate all domains in the `moneycorp.local` forest**
- [x] **Map the trusts of the `dollarcorp.moneycorp.local` domain**
- [x] **Map External trusts in `moneycorp.local` forest**
- [x] **Identify external trusts of `dollarcorp` domain. Can you enumerate trusts for a trusting forest?**

#### 05 [Learning Objective](./learning_objective_05.md)

- [x] **Exploit a service on `dcorp-student422` and elevate privileges to local administrator**
- [x] **Identify a machine in the domain where `student422` has local administrative access**
- [x] **Using privileges of a user on Jenkins on `172.16.3.11:8080`, get admin privileges on `172.16.3.11`, the `dcorp-ci` server**
